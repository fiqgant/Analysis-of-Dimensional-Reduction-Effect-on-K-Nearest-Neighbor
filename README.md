Based on the results, the performance of classifiers with LDA is better than with PCA on datasets withmore than 100 attributes. Arrhythmia datasets canimprove performance on K-NN K=3 and K=5. The best performance is obtained by LDA+K-NN K=3 which produces an accuracy value of 98.53%, the lowest performancefound in K-NN without reduction withK=3. ISOLET datasets,the best performance results are also obtained by data that has been reduced with LDA,but the best performance is obtained when the classification of K-NN with K=5 and the lowest performance is found in PCA+ K-NN with a value of K=3. As for the best performance,dataset CNAE-9 is also achieved by LDA+K-NN, while the lowest performance is PCA+K-NN with the value of K=3.
